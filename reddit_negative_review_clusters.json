year with pixel 8.So I got my G Pixel 8 on December 2023 because a cousin recommended it for me (he got a great time with the Pixel 5) and after one year with it, I can say it was the worst phone I got... Let me explainThe pixel 8 is an amazing phone, exceptional camera, great UI, nice processor, nice battery, nice AI options. But sadly, after 5 months of using the phone, the screen started blinking. I didn't think much of it at the time, assuming it was just an update error. Then the months passed, and the blinking became more frequent until the screen turned green. It pissed the hell out of me because I had never dropped the phone. After that, I realized my mistake when I chose this phone.Also I got issues like ghost touches, overheating and after the green screen problem, time later a white line appeared on the damn screen, and more bad stuff.In Latam, specifically in Costa Rica, there isn't a Google store or anything like that, so I wasn't able to use the warranty. Of course is my fault for choosing a phone with no physical store in Costa Rica but definitely Google doesn't make good phones. (Or Im not lucky)If you from latam and you got the money and you want a nice phone, you must go for an iPhone, iPhones last for years, mi madre got a XR(2018) and it still working like the first day","1":"2 phones 1 sim.Hi, just picked up a pixel 7 pro for a second phone..

","2":"I dropped my phone and my screen went black until I took it to a repair shop. During that time I realized I couldn't even use my Google account on other devices since Google was querying 2 step verification with my broken phone. What can I do to avoid this in the future?.Is there a backup plan where I can do security questions or put in my wife's email as a backup?","3":"Pixel 8 Pro screen scratches after 2 days?! What rubbish is this?.Anyone had sudden smudges or scratches show up (even slight blemishes) on their GP8pro?

Two days ago I woke up to go the washroom, and saw my phone notifying me that it would reboot soon to install Android 15. It was charging, so I figured, no problem, do your thing. I came back from the washroom to find the screen black, but with a backlight still. I thought it was rebooting, so I waited. The backlight eventually went away, and that was it. Since then I've been unable to turn it on at all. No recovery mode, bootloader screen, no \\`adb devices\\`, nothing. It's dead, not a single light or sign of life when I charge it or plug it into a PC.I took it to an authorized repair shop, they opened the phone, tried a new battery, no luck. Apparently the internals of the pixel are not modular at all. There's a battery module, a camera module, and \"everything else\" integrated into the motherboard.I'm devastated. \"New Phone Money\" is not something that comes easy to me these days, and this happening as part of an Android update pushed by google itself feels very wrong. I contacted the support and was told that my phone was out of warranty (I bought it in 2022), and that there's nothing they can do. I found this response infuriating and unfair. If a company is pushing OTA updates, the least it can do is offer a store credit for when these updates brick someone's phone.Anyhow, I don't mean to spread fear, and so far I was only able to find 3 other Pixel 7\/7as that bricked during this update, so it's clearly not widespread enough for google to care I think.","14":"My Pixel 5 just died..Black screen, not charging.Nothing.

It works like 70% of the time. This is absolutely not acceptable. I have tried to disable Adaptive Touch on Stock Android. I have tried also GrapheneOS with Increased Touch Sensitivity. It helped to come to the 70%, but are there other options which can be turned on\/off?I have tried with and without screen protector. With its a bit kore accurate, but no where near 85% of the time unfortunately.On Pixel 5 it was accurate and worked in 99% of the time for me.Hope you can give some more tips, before selling my phone.","16":"sick of my pixel 8 pro already after only 5 days -software problems.So long story short. I bought a pixel 8 pro because of the cameras. I do youtube videos and wanted good cameras.  But i've only had it 5 days and already it given me loads of software problems. 1st won't recogise usb flash or external hard drives, so i can't them as external memory. Now it won't copy music, mps files from my other phone.What really annoys me, is i had my old Xiaomi poco f3 for 5 years and never had a problem with anything. Everything just worked on it.  If i keep having problems this will be the last pixel i ever buy. And lastly, i can see by how many people are posting about their problems here, so that's not only me. ","17":"Pixel 5 Battery Potentially Swelling.My Pixel 5's screen has become very loose and I've had to use tape to hold it down. I don't know if it's an issue with the glue weakining over time (my power button has also fallen out), or the battery on the inside is swelling, causing the screen to pop out. Last summer, my phone regularly got quite hot & the battery started to drain quickly which could also be battery related. My speakers are also very messed up & my volume buttons stop clicking properly which I don't know is related.I'm also aware that Google was offering free battery placements for Pixel 4a users because there was some issues with the batteries on those phone and I wonder if the same issue is affecting Pixel 5 users.","18":"Let me tell you a story of my mom losing EVERYTHING because her Pixel 6 decided to die. (And why you need to check your recovery options NOW.).I'm absolutely floored and frustrated, and I need to share this cautionary tale. My mom, mid-60s and not exactly a tech wizard, is currently locked out of her entire digital life, and it's all because her Google Pixel 6 decided to abruptly brick itself.Here's the breakdown:* **The Sudden Death:** A few days ago, her Pixel 6 just went dark. No warning, no signs. A lab couldn't revive it.* **The Recovery Nightmare:** My mom, bless her heart, apparently never set up a separate recovery email. Or, if she did, it was the same email she's now locked out of.* **The Google Voice Trap:** Her recovery phone number is her old US Google Voice number. She and my dad moved overseas less than a year ago and got a local number, but, as you can imagine, changing recovery numbers wasn't a priority for her.* **The Password Paradox:** She actually remembers her Google password, but it seems she got locked out after multiple attempts (or some other Google security measure). Now, it's forcing verification via that US Google Voice number, which is inaccessible because the phone is dead.* **The Chromebook Betrayal:** She has a Chromebook, which I thought would be a saving grace. Nope. It mysteriously signed her out, and it's also requiring verification via the same inaccessible number.* **The Fallout:** All her important accounts\u2014health portals (MyChart), Facebook, everything\u2014are tied to that Google account. She's essentially lost access to her medical records and social connections.I'm beyond frustrated. This is a complete disaster. We've opened a new email, but it's a band-aid on a gaping wound.Seriously, how is this not happening to more people, especially older folks? Phones can just die, and if you don't have robust recovery options, you're screwed.**My Plea to You:*** Go. Now. Check your recovery email and phone number. Make sure they're up-to-date and accessible.* Set up multiple recovery options.* Consider a legacy contact.* Get those authenticator app offline codes and store them somewhere safe.* Back up everything, and test your backups.* Educate your older family members.It's insane how much we rely on these devices and accounts, and how easily it can all be taken away.Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.TL;DR: Mom's Pixel 6 died, she's locked out of her Google account, and therefore, her entire digital life, because of outdated recovery info. Check your recovery options NOW.","19":"My Google Pixel 7 phone died in front of my eyes, as it updated to Android 15.I've been in the Google ecosystem for years now, and have had Gioogle phones since they were called Nexus phones, starting by the Galaxy Nexus, then Nexus 4, and finally Nexus 6p.My current phone was a Google Pixel 7, and I absolutely loved it.

Except it technically isn't random.  It seems to happen overnight.  This is the second time in a row it's happened.  I have Japanese as a system language and a keyboard language.  The default language for my phone is English and the apps it allows me to change are set as such.  I like having Japanese as a system language because I do type in it sometimes.  But I never change it to be the language for my phone.  What's weird is that it only happens in the Quick Settings menu and Outlook.  If I kill Outlook and restart it that fixes it for that. But for my phone I have to restart it.  Has anyone else experienced this and resolved it?","21":"Pixel 8 Pro screen scratches after 2 days?!

Fantastic software in an affordable package with a great camera. As the techie in the family, my partner, mother, and father now have one. I started with Nexus 5 which made me drink the Google Kool-Aid. I drive a car from 2003 that I keep running. This laptop is over a decade old. I take care of things and expect my things to last. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be possible with Pixel phones.Flash forward to my next phone after the Nexus 5: The Nexus 5X. This phone was always in a case, I cleaned charging port regularly, no drops, screen protector etc. Nonetheless, it died a sudden premature death from the well known bootlooping issue. Google accepted responsibility and sent me a refurb. Faith in Google restored.Decided I wanted an upgrade, so I sprung for a Pixel 5a. Rear fingerprint sensor, great battery, aux port, software that can keep up with my usage. I had no intention of leaving this phone. Again, this phone was babied, has lived in a case, away from heat\/moisture all the things. This morning I woke up, saw a text message and the phone suddenly froze and shut off. Could not revive the phone into recovery, computer cannot detect device, etc. It's clear that it's been a victim of the well documented motherboard defect. Google support will *not* accept responsibility (it's apparently two months outside extended warranty). So, my question to the community is: Are Pixel phones just not built to last? Ironically, my Nexus 5 (made by LG) is now housing my SIM card until I find a replacement. This phone was released in 2013 and has now been used *twice* as a backup once my Nexus 5X and Pixel 5A prematurely kicked the bucket. Am I just unlucky?  I've seen other documented motherboard faults with other newer Pixels as well. This does not inspire confidence to invest more money in the Pixel line. The 7 and 8 are both in my price range but the principle of owning a device that's a ticking time bomb with little or no manufacturer support tell me no.T;dr: My past two Google phones have each had manufacturer defects that bricked the device despite babying them. Are Pixel phones just not built to last? If not, what manufacturer (besides Apple) has better build quality?","29":"Unfortunately, after 13 years, I'm leaving team Pixel..And I know you all don't care (I wouldn't).

My dad is terminally sick and I can't afford to lose calls at the moment. Seems there's no fix for this, so have to sell the phone. Don't know what I'm going to get, but something people can call me on, at least. This problem is really something I can't overlook, and will not be getting Pixel again.If you know the fix, which I couldn't find, please save me and help.Cheers friends.","30":"Weekly #TeamPixel Photos Megathread March 13 2025.This is the weekly photo Megathread.

Came with a watch free, which is okay, randomly dies sometimes but it's all right. I am now having deep and maddening regret of my choice. Mostly because now I have a Mac so the ecosystem would rock. I have lost so many things too. 1. The taptic engine is really good, I just prefer it opposed to the pixel. 2. I live outside the US so most of the features don't work for me. 3. Love the control I have over my phone. Sometimes. Because when an idiot like me is given the choice to change so many things about something so integral to life- I am going to mess it up. 4. Kinda forgot that 90% of everyone I meet has an iPhone- so I lose my airdrop, the touch to transfer thingy, iMessage (big one and I can't get it to work on mac). 5. Developers for iPhone are governed by apple's stringent quality control. 6. iPhone is wildly popular and widely documented. Almost all your issues are probably covered somewhere on the interweb, which is not the case for pixel. 7. Apples design is clean, and personally I prefer it to pixel's design. There's way more reasons but can't think of em rn. So I'm trying and looking around on how to switch back- but every option looks expensive.Only thing I'll really, really miss is the pixel's camera, the look of which I love. But I'll probably find some raw capture app on the app store to try and recoup that. Just irritated atp.","35":"My Google Pixel 7 phone died in front of my eyes, as it updated to Android 15.I've been in the Google ecosystem for years now, and have had Gioogle phones since they were called Nexus phones, starting by the Galaxy Nexus, then Nexus 4, and finally Nexus 6p.My current phone was a Google Pixel 7, and I absolutely loved it. Two days ago I woke up to go the washroom, and saw my phone notifying me that it would reboot soon to install Android 15. It was charging, so I figured, no problem, do your thing. I came back from the washroom to find the screen black, but with a backlight still. I thought it was rebooting, so I waited. The backlight eventually went away, and that was it. Since then I've been unable to turn it on at all. No recovery mode, bootloader screen, no \\`adb devices\\`, nothing. It's dead, not a single light or sign of life when I charge it or plug it into a PC.I took it to an authorized repair shop, they opened the phone, tried a new battery, no luck. Apparently the internals of the pixel are not modular at all. There's a battery module, a camera module, and \"everything else\" integrated into the motherboard.I'm devastated. \"New Phone Money\" is not something that comes easy to me these days, and this happening as part of an Android update pushed by google itself feels very wrong. I contacted the support and was told that my phone was out of warranty (I bought it in 2022), and that there's nothing they can do. I found this response infuriating and unfair. If a company is pushing OTA updates, the least it can do is offer a store credit for when these updates brick someone's phone.Anyhow, I don't mean to spread fear, and so far I was only able to find 3 other Pixel 7\/7as that bricked during this update, so it's clearly not widespread enough for google to care I think.","36":"(USA) Google Wallet and Android 15 new NFC default app \"none\".TLDR; I just set the default NFC app to \"none\" but not been anywhere yet to try it out. Will it stop NFC payment from going through until a payment app is open?    Pixel 8a, Android 15. I don't need or want NFC to work for payment unless I have already opened google wallet app (even if the phone is already unlocked).     In the past, my phone had to be unlocked (as per the setting to require unlock) but my payment app (Google Wallet) did NOT have to be open for NFC payment to go through. I didn't much care for that behavior, but it wasn't an issue because the devices I encountered always needed to be within several inches of my phone.     Lately I am finding more and more devices that engage my phone from well over a foot away. I came very close to paying for another customer's purchase last week, thankfully my phone had been unlocked for a little while as I was using my shopping list, I have biometrics on and was prompted for my fingerprint to verify my identity before making a purchase.     So now I really really really don't want NFC payment capability unless I have already opened the Wallet app (or any other payment app, should I ever have multiple). Will this default app setting of \"none\" achieve it?","37":"Why doesn't the latest Pixel on Android 15 have an option to require a password before powering down the phone?.With Android 15, Google has introduced several theft protection features like Theft Detection Lock and Remote Lock. However, there seems to be a glaring security gap: there is no option to require authentication (e.g., a password or PIN) when accessing the power menu to shut down the device. This omission allows thieves to quickly power off a stolen phone, disabling tracking features like \"Find My Device.\"While third-party apps claim to address this issue, they are ineffective on Pixel devices due to system-level restrictions. Why hasn\u2019t Google implemented such a basic feature, especially when it could significantly enhance security? Is there any workaround or hope for this feature in future updates?","38":"Status bar Android 15 (Pixel8pro).Wasn't the purpuse of the status bar to be quick?Why nowadays to turn off for example Bluetooth i have to tap 3 times.

My main Google account is 20+ years old. I have 2FA enabled with a passkey (my pixel phone) and a yubikey. I have advanced protection enabled. For recovery I have my phone number & non-gmail email. For the past 3 weeks I am getting Google prompts asking if I am trying to recovery my account. They are coming from a different country. It's incredible annoying and I worry I'll fat finger yes (or my toddler will). I tried disabling Google play services alerts, however now I don't get an alert but rather instantly get a FULL screen prompt (which is much worse).Ideas? Anyways to tell if they are using my phone number to try and recover vs my email? ","43":"Google has created a privacy nightmare with Google Password Manager that will store all of your passwords in the cloud, you cannot opt to \"only have your passwords stored locally on device\", Google will only let you store your passwords in the cloud. Man I hate Google so much!!!.So I was installing facebook messenger on my Google pixel android smartphone and when I got to the part where I enter my password for facebook messenger, Google asked me to save my password to Google Password Manager so I can use my password on all devices, so it stored my password in the cloud. There is no way to opt out of this. There is no option to only store my password locally on my device and NOT in the cloud.Google is ramming this down our throats.This is a privacy nightmare! So check it out, when you upload a pic or vid to google cloud guess what happens, well first, google will have AI look at your pics and vids to look for child porn (they run your files against a hash value system, all internet companies do this). Google even takes this a step further than other companies, google now has an AI that will look at your uploaded pics and vids and go \"Is that child porn?\" If the AI determines that it is indeed child porn, then that AI will tell a human to come look at it.So this is separate from the hash value system. Google has an AI that will simply look at your pics and vids and try to determine if it's CP or not.And this has happened to innocent people who simply uploaded naked pics of their toddler children. The google AI deemed it to be CP and then flagged it so a human could look at it and then guess what? The fucking human called the cops on these innocent people. And apart from calling the cops, google also locked these people out of their google accounts so they lost access to precious valuable family photos and what not they had stored in their google cloud account. Family pics they'll never got back cause Google is evil like that.You can read more about it here \"A Dad Took Photos of His Naked Toddler for the Doctor. Google Flagged Him as a Criminal. Google has an automated tool to detect abusive images of children. But the system can get it wrong, and the consequences are serious.\"\u00a0[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html)So Steve Jobs once famously said, and I might not get this quote right word for word but he said \"Why should other people have more privacy than I do?\" So Steve Jobs was big on privacy and so this is why when you upload pics and vids to Apple cloud, Apple DOES NOT automatically scan them for child porn. And that is because when you upload files to your Apple cloud account, it's end to end encrypted so Apple could not get access to your files even if someone held a gun to their head. Because it's end to end encrypted.A while back Apple was going to begin scanning files for child porn, they were going to do this locally on your device before the files were sent to Apple cloud but there was a massive outcry from the privacy community over this so Apple backed down.So listen, google does indeed encrypt your information that's stored in the cloud but they hold the encryption keys so they can decrypt and look at your stuff anytime they want to (and they do this cause from I understand they periodically scan your stuff looking for child porn or scan it for whatever reason they want). Whereas Apple can't decrypt your stuff cause they use end to end encryption. Only you have the password to your Apple cloud account, only you have the encryption key.And hey if I'm wrong about anything here then please let me know. I appreciate feedback.I'm so pissed off about this. Yeah google is ramming Google Password Manager down our throats. They could easily give you the option to only store your passwords locally on device but of course google doesn't wanna do that. Why would they do that? They want your information.I mean this is a privacy nightmare, so if the police want to (and they do this all the time) they will tell Google to give them access to all of your google accounts, so whatever information google has about you, the police get to see this. And the police do this if they are investigating you. So this would mean the cops would get all of your passwords that you use to login to facebook, reddit, X, instagram, tiktok, whatever app you use, they get access to your passwords cause your passwords are now stored in google cloud.So the government can now get access to your passwords (cause the police are agents of the government) that you use to login to everything so you see how this is a privacy nightmare? And also what if google gets hacked?At this point I will most likely get rid of my android smartphone and go get an Apple iPhone. Google has no respect for your privacy at all.The reason I haven't already jumped over to an iPhone is cause the iPhone doesn't have a dedicated back button or a dedicated app selector button. On my android smartphone at the very bottom of the screen you'll see three buttons, from left to right you got a dedicated back button, a dedicated home button, and a dedicated app selector button. Apple can be weird sometimes, they don't have a dedicated back or app selector button.But this is the last straw Google!!!!!! I'm gonna have to jump over to iPhone at this point. Fuck you Google.I don't want my passwords stored in the cloud. I want my passwords only stored locally on device. I want what emails and passwords I use to login to these various different apps to be stored locally on device and not in the cloud.So there might be a way to only store your passwords locally on device but Google is purposely making it very confusing to do this. I know cause I've checked the settings. Google is purposely making it confusing cause why? Cause they want your data that's why! Fuck Google.You'd think they'd offer \"only store passwords locally on device\" but nope, why would Google do that?From Google AI Overview:While\u00a0not all Apple Cloud data is automatically end-to-end encrypted, you can enable \"Advanced Data Protection\" to achieve a high level of end-to-end encryption for most of your iCloud data, including photos, backups, notes, and more, meaning only you have the keys to access your information, not even Apple itself;\u00a0this feature is optional and requires you to set up a recovery method in case you lose access to your account.\u00a0So yes Apple does have end to end encryption for iCloud but apparently it's NOT on by default. Tim Cook you bastard that should be turned on by default. RESPECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY!!!

However what Google neglected to tell me was that what actually happened was when I installed Google Photos it came with automatic backup which they don\u2019t ask permission to turn on anymore, which filled my Google Cloud storage quickly.

Before that, I had a Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. I bought it because I had always used Android (from different brands) and wanted a change. At the time, no Android phone really appealed to me, so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to try something different. That\u2019s how I ended up getting a refurbished iPhone 13.Here\u2019s what disappointed me:\t\u2022\tFirst thing: I bought it in pink, but it actually looks more white than pink (not a big deal, but still).\t\u2022\tI almost always keep my phone on silent since I spend most of my time in class or at work, and I find the notification system absolutely terrible. There\u2019s no small icon at the top of the screen, and notifications barely show up on the lock screen, so I have to manually check for them multiple times a day. Because of that, I sometimes receive messages and completely forget to reply.\t\u2022\tI don\u2019t understand why my home screen wallpaper is blurry. I don\u2019t want it to be blurry, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to fix it in the settings. Either way, I shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings just to correct something like this.\t\u2022\tWhen I turn off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, why does it only stay off until the next day before turning itself back on?? I get that maybe it\u2019s to prevent unnecessary data usage, and sure, maybe I could change this in the settings, but I don\u2019t want to constantly mess around in the settings for basic things like this!\t\u2022\tWhen I watch a YouTube video in landscape mode while lying in bed, the screen doesn\u2019t automatically rotate. I have to exit fullscreen and reopen it for the orientation to be correct.\t\u2022\tHonestly, I thought I\u2019d get used to it, but I hate swiping to go back. When I\u2019m watching slideshows on TikTok, it\u2019s annoying to have to stretch my hand all the way to the edge of the screen just to go back\u2014it\u2019s just not practical.\t\u2022\tIn general, there are so many restrictions on what I can do, and I constantly feel like the phone is preventing me from using it how I want.\t\u2022\tThe mute switch on the left side: I find it super impractical. I have to fidget with it to know if my phone is on silent, and sometimes there\u2019s a delay (though I wonder if that\u2019s because my phone is refurbished and maybe the switch is faulty).\t\u2022\tTo adjust notification or alarm volume, I have to go back to the home screen because if an app is open, I can\u2019t adjust the system volume directly.\t\u2022\tFace ID: I don\u2019t know if mine is buggy, but a friend who has always used iPhones tried it and said it was normal, so I guess that\u2019s just how it works. But personally, I find it super slow; sometimes it doesn\u2019t work, and when I\u2019m lying down, it doesn\u2019t always recognize me. I had to make a Reddit post complaining about Face ID just for someone to tell me that when unlocking my phone, I could tap \u201cFace ID\u201d to enter my passcode faster. Like\u2026 it\u2019s written nowhere that I could do that. How was I supposed to guess??\t\u2022\tThe photos honestly aren\u2019t that impressive. I compared them to my 2018 Galaxy S8, and while they\u2019re decent quality, they\u2019re nothing incredible. In fact, I find them a bit dull.\t\u2022\tThere are no numbers displayed at the top of my keyboard.\t\u2022\tWhen I log into something and receive an SMS code, I have to tap on it manually to autofill it, whereas even my 2018 Galaxy S8 did this automatically. (Okay, maybe I\u2019m nitpicking here, but still.)\t\u2022\tTo turn off my phone, I have to press the power button AND volume up at the same time. The first time, I had to ask a friend for help because I just couldn\u2019t figure it out. I mean, if there\u2019s a power button, logically, holding it should turn the phone off.\t\u2022\tThe default calculator app is garbage, right? I\u2019m a waitress, and I use my phone\u2019s calculator to count my cash register at the end of the night. Who thought it was a good idea to remove the calculation history?? I don\u2019t get it. They want the phone to be so sleek and minimalist that it actually becomes unusable. I had to download a separate calculator app, which is just ridiculous.\t\u2022\tWhen someone calls me, there\u2019s no direct \u201cDecline\u201d button on the screen. Again, not a big deal, but I find it inconvenient.\t\u2022\tThe phone gets scratched super easily. When I first got it, I had to use it for two days without a case because mine hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Despite being careful, the metal edges already got scratched, and I have no idea how.\t\u2022\tThe snooze lasts 9 minutes??\t\u2022\tWriting and editing text on an iPhone is unnecessarily complicated.\t\u2022\tI can\u2019t close all my browser tabs at once.I know that a lot of these issues can probably be fixed in the settings, but:\t1.\tI shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings for things that, to me, should be basic.\t2.\tA brand-new iPhone is ridiculously expensive. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t buy the latest model, because for the price, this phone should be reading my mind.To give you an idea: in the first month, I was so disappointed compared to everything iPhone fans had told me that I actually went to an Apple Store to check if my phone was even real.I know I\u2019m complaining about a lot of little things, and maybe I\u2019m just used to Android, which makes some things stand out more. But considering the insane price of an iPhone, I feel like I have every right to nitpick.Anyway, I think I\u2019ll sell my phone this summer. (I hate doing that; I\u2019ve always used my phones until they were completely broken.) But I just can\u2019t see myself keeping it. I\u2019ll get something else instead.Edit: I also want to say that I don\u2019t like not being able to place my app icons on the home screen wherever I want. I don\u2019t get it\u2014the phone costs an entire month\u2019s salary. If I\u2019m paying that much and I want a page with a big empty space in the middle with no apps, I should have the right to do that, right??

If not, what are your other pet peeves?.Today I was thinking about how similar iOS and Android are today, but at the same time, it's crazy that small details make all the difference.My biggest pet peeve with iOS is the lack of a Back button.I often look at people in public transport, to see how they manage to go back with iPhones.No matter if they are young or old, male or female, the Back gesture works 80% of the time for them.It's just that they're used to it, so if it fails, they immediately do it again.I don't think that's a nice user experience for such a common action.If only it was as simple as doing the gesture! No.. no.. Sometimes the gesture doesnt work just because the developer of the app didn't implement it. Then you learn you can only tap the arrow button on the top left, Sometimes you realize you can only continue with the flow of the app (eg tapping Next).Sometimes you realize the gesture doesnt work because there's a Done\/Cancel text button at the top right corner.Now, even if they fixed that mess and added a navigation bar like on Android, there are still pet peeves that would keep me from moving:1. You can't plug an iPhone to a PC and expect to see files and folders. You need to use iTunes.2. You can't safely charge an iPhone with a wireless charger that isn't an original Apple one ($40), as the phone can get crazy hot; even without a case. 3. The notifications are hard to dismiss. You need to do a weird swipe down to expose that view, and then a broad gesture to dismiss it towards the bottom.4. No double tap to turn off the screen and lock.5. Face id forces you to pick up the phone. So, no unlocking when it's flat on a table, unless you awkwardly reach out to show your face.What am I missing?","210":"So, what IS going on with this \"pink line\" screen issue that seems to be happening on every phone?.For years users have experienced their screens slowly dieing on them.

Since then...My iPhone has been fallen off the second story of a houseSunk to the bottom of a hot spring in YosemiteRemined functional in 120**\u00b0** F heat in the Mohave desert (heat wave 2022)Remained functional in -6**\u00b0** F crazy freezing temperatures in Canada (last week)Been trampled by a heaving rush at New Delhi Station (if you know, you know)Approached both the lowest and highest elevations on earthGot immersed in all manner of dust, sand, liquids and, uh, other stuffSpent months in places with average humidity levels of 90%Experienced several power surges while charging (thank you Third World hostels)Outlived four Belkin cases, three lightning cables, and two pairs of plugin EarPodsAll the while never going in for a repair or battery replacement. All the while doing all the things I need a phone to do (including being a vital tool in the collection and documentation of fieldwork data for a doctoral dissertation)And still it soldiers on!My last iOS update was in July and I have been holding out since then for the \"new SE\" because even this old diehard is starting to show its age. But even this lowliest of iPhone has stood the test of time and proven its enduring value. And also, after a disastrous experience with an Android circa 2011 I'm never going back to that hot mess.In a few short days I will pay $599 for an iPhone 16e. In 2016 I paid $449 for an SE with 64gb of storage. Adjusting for inflation, that was $602 in 2025 dollars. And so, for effectively $3 dollars less than I paid for my last iPhone, I will be getting a 16e with:Double the storage \/ quadruple the ram \/ quadruple the GPUs \/ USB-C (thank goodness) \/ something called Apple Intelligence \/ and a device that I suppose is more in line with the typical smartphone experience in the 2020sAm I still getting a bad deal?Yes, I am a weirdo. I did not really know what MagSafe was until I looked up 16e reviews last week (still don't care, sorry not sorry). I confine my gaming to a proper, high performance laptop, thank you very much. I watch movies in my living room on a bigscreen. I leave the photographs for a DSLR. I seek devices with durability and futureproofing, and to those ends Apple has earned my trust.There are many like me, believe it or not, we just don't post on reddit or tech websites about our phones.

However, as soon as I zoom in beyond 1x, the audio completely changes and becomes muffled. Since the person on stage is using a microphone and their voice comes from the speakers, that sound disappears as well. Additionally, the entire band's background music becomes muffled. My entire concert recording is ruined.For the next concert, I followed everyone's recommendation and switched the recording audio to mono, but that didn\u2019t work either. I also tried disabling sound isolation, as suggested by other sources, but that didn\u2019t help.The only solution for now seems to be recording the concert audio separately with another phone.

It wasn't a big artist's concert, as you might assume.Now that I've explained this, can we focus on the main issue: why does a phone I paid over $1000 for completely ruin all the sound when I zoom in?The same thing happened during cinematic recording as well.","302":"iPhone 14 Pro Max Lighting HDMI adapter does YouTube full screen on the TV - iPhone 15 Pro Max USB-C HDMI adapter only mirrors screen in the YouTube app on the TV with big black borders.iPhone 14 Pro Max Lighting HDMI adapter does YouTube full screen on the TV - iPhone 15 Pro Max USB-C HDMI adapter only mirrors screen in the YouTube app on the TV with big black bordersdoes this happen to anyone else?

People were quick to blame me instead of Apple.I contacted Apple directly who received images of the damage. They escalated it to their engineering team who concluded moisture or dust caused the issue and that this was user error.When I contacted Apple Norway they were shocked about the outcome, this was against Norwegian, and EU law, but since this was escalated to the highest level of Apple they had no authority on the matter.I reached out to Norwegian News Media who made a news articleApple concluded that the charging equipment used had no relevance, the heat was generated in the phone and caused by a short circuit. Given that it is IP68, and phones are exposed to dust everyday, not taking this more seriously is absolutely insane, and a potential safety hazard. As you can see in the pictures from the news article, this was NOT a dirty phoneI did get this fixed going through my home insurance, but Apple was not at all willing to help, and did not at all take this seriously.

out of her entire digital life and it s all because her google pixel 6 decided to abruptly brick itself here s the breakdown the sudden death a few days ago her pixel 6 just went dark no warning no signs a lab couldn t revive it the recovery nightmare my mom bless her heart apparently never set up a separate recovery email or if she did it was the same email she s now locked out of the google voice trap her recovery phone number is her old us google voice number she and my dad moved overseas less than a year ago and got a local number but as you can imagine changing recovery numbers wasn t a priority for her the password paradox she actually remembers her google password but it seems she got locked out after multiple attempts or some other google security measure now it s forcing verification via that us google voice number which is inaccessible because the phone is dead the chromebook betrayal she has a chromebook which i thought would be a saving grace nope it mysteriously signed her out and it s also requiring verification via the same inaccessible number the fallout all her important accounts health portals mychart facebook everything are tied to that google account she s essentially lost access to her medical records and social connections i m beyond frustrated this is a complete disaster we ve opened a new email but it s a band aid on a gaping wound seriously how is this not happening to more people especially older folks phones can just die and if you don t have robust recovery options you re screwed my plea to you go now check your recovery email and phone number make sure they re up to date and accessible set up multiple recovery options consider a legacy contact get those authenticator app offline codes and store them somewhere safe back up everything and test your backups educate your older family members it s insane how much we rely on these devices and accounts and how easily it can all be taken away has anyone else experienced

the family my partner mother and father now have one i started with nexus 5 which made me drink the google kool aid i drive a car from 2003 that i keep running this laptop is over a decade old i take care of things and expect my things to last unfortunately this does not seem to be possible with pixel phones flash forward to my next phone after the nexus 5 the nexus 5x this phone was always in a case i cleaned charging port regularly no drops screen protector etc nonetheless it died a sudden premature death from the well known bootlooping issue google accepted responsibility and sent me a refurb faith in google restored decided i wanted an upgrade so i sprung for a pixel 5a rear fingerprint sensor great battery aux port software that can keep up with my usage i had no intention of leaving this phone again this phone was babied has lived in a case away from heat moisture all the things this morning i woke up saw a text message and the phone suddenly froze and shut off could not revive the phone into recovery computer cannot detect device etc it s clear that it s been a victim of the well documented motherboard defect google support will not accept responsibility it s apparently two months outside extended warranty so my question to the community is are pixel phones just not built to last ironically my nexus 5 made by lg is now housing my sim card until i find a replacement this phone was released in 2013 and has now been used twice as a backup once my nexus 5x and pixel 5a prematurely kicked the bucket am i just unlucky i ve seen other documented motherboard faults with other newer pixels as well this does not inspire confidence to invest more money in the pixel line the 7 and 8 are both in my price range but the principle of owning a device that s a ticking time bomb with little or no manufacturer support tell me no t dr my past two google phones have each had manufacturer defects that bricked the device despite babying them are pixel phones just not built to last if not what manufacturer besides apple has better build quality ","29":"unfortunately after 13 years i m leaving team pixel and i know you all don t care i wouldn t but i m not happy

thieves to quickly power off a stolen phone disabling tracking features like find my device while third party apps claim to address this issue they are ineffective on pixel devices due to system level

cannot opt to only have your passwords stored locally on device google will only let you store your passwords in the cloud man i hate google so much so i was installing facebook messenger on my google pixel android smartphone and when i got to the part where i enter my password for facebook messenger google asked me to save my password to google password manager so i can use my password on all devices so it stored my password in the cloud there is no way to opt out of this there is no option to only store my password locally on my device and not in the cloud google is ramming this down our throats this is a privacy nightmare so check it out when you upload a pic or vid to google cloud guess what happens well first google will have ai look at your pics and vids to look for child porn they run your files against a hash value system all internet companies do this google even takes this a step further than other companies google now has an ai that will look at your uploaded pics and vids and go is that child porn if the ai determines that it is indeed child porn then that ai will tell a human to come look at it so this is separate from the hash value system google has an ai that will simply look at your pics and vids and try to determine if it s cp or not and this has happened to innocent people who simply uploaded naked pics of their toddler children the google ai deemed it to be cp and then flagged it so a human could look at it and then guess what the fucking human called the cops on these innocent people and apart from calling the cops google also locked these people out of their google accounts so they lost access to precious valuable family photos and what not they had stored in their google cloud account family pics they ll never got back cause google is evil like that you can read more about it here a dad took photos of his naked toddler for the doctor google flagged him as a criminal google has an automated tool to detect abusive images of children but the system can get it wrong and the consequences are serious https www nytimes com 2022 08 21 technology google surveillance toddler photo html https www nytimes com 2022 08 21 technology google surveillance toddler photo html so steve jobs once famously said and i might not get this quote right word for word but he said why should other people have more privacy than i do so steve jobs was big on privacy and so this is why when you upload pics and vids to apple cloud apple does not automatically scan them for child porn and that is because when you upload files to your apple cloud account it s end to end encrypted so apple could not get access to your files even if someone held a gun to their head because it s end to end encrypted a while back apple was going to begin scanning files for child porn they were going to do this locally on your device before the files were sent to apple cloud but there was a massive outcry from the privacy community over this so apple backed down so listen google does indeed encrypt your information that s stored in the cloud but they hold the encryption keys so they can decrypt and look at your stuff anytime they want to and they do this cause from i understand they periodically scan your stuff looking for child porn or scan it for whatever reason they want whereas apple can t decrypt your stuff cause they use end to end encryption only you have the password to your apple cloud account only you have the encryption key and hey if i m wrong about anything here then please let me know i appreciate feedback i m so pissed off about this yeah google is ramming google password manager down our throats they could easily give you the option to only store your passwords locally on device but of course google doesn t wanna do that why would they do that they want your information i mean this is a privacy nightmare so if the police want to and they do this all the time they will tell google to give them access to all of your google accounts so whatever information google has about you the police get to see this and the police do this if they are investigating you so this would mean the cops would get all of your passwords that you use to login to facebook reddit x instagram tiktok whatever app you use they get access to your passwords cause your passwords are now stored in google cloud so the government can now get access to your passwords cause the police are agents of the government that you use to login to everything so you see how this is a privacy nightmare and also what if google gets hacked at this point i will most likely get rid of my android smartphone and go get an apple iphone google has no respect for your privacy at all the reason i haven t already jumped over to an iphone is cause the iphone doesn t have a dedicated back button or a dedicated app selector button on my android smartphone at the very bottom of the screen you ll see three buttons from left to right you got a dedicated back button a dedicated home button and a dedicated app selector button apple can be weird sometimes they don t have a dedicated back or app selector button but this is the last straw google i m gonna have to jump over to iphone at this point fuck you google i don t want my passwords stored in the cloud i want my passwords only stored locally on device i want what emails and passwords i use to login to these various different apps to be stored locally on device and not in the cloud so there might be a way to only store your passwords locally on device but google is purposely making it very confusing to do this i know cause i ve checked the settings google is purposely making it confusing cause why cause they want your data that s why fuck google you d think they d offer only store passwords locally on device but nope why would google do that from google ai overview while not all apple cloud data is automatically end to end encrypted you can enable advanced data protection to achieve a high level of end to end encryption for most of your icloud data including photos backups notes and more meaning only you have the keys to access your information not even apple itself this feature is optional and requires you to set up a recovery method in case you lose access to your account so yes apple does have end to end encryption for icloud but apparently it s not on by default tim cook you bastard that should be turned on by default respect people s privacy we have a right to privacy this is the 4th amendment of the u s constitution the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers

neglected to tell me was that what actually happened was when i installed google photos it came with automatic backup which they don t ask permission to turn on anymore which filled my google cloud storage quickly then they told me that i needed to clear out 45 gb of photo and video files to get down under the limit or purchase more storage space in the cloud for 19 99 when i found out that i had deleted 2 years of photos and videos from my device i went to the google photos app and went to the trash folder and selected restore all and nothing happened i tried a second time and this time everything disappeared and has not returned to my google photos library nor the device s google does say in the trash section of their photos app that all photos will be available for 60 days after they are deleted from google photos apparently this is a lie i went to having 20 000 pictures and videos on my phone to less than half that and it seems like google is deleting more on their own as we speak pictures that i took this afternoon that were in my photo library are no longer there is there anything i can do google for one deleted pictures of my daughter from ages 5 7 and many other memories from someone who will in the not to distant future lack the ability to recall any of them on my own they also promised the photos would be available up to 60 days after deleting and they

buying an iphone i ve regretted buying an iphone iphone 13 for the past seven months now before that i had a samsung galaxy s21 fe i bought it because i had always used android from different brands and wanted a change at the time no android phone really appealed to me so i figured it was the perfect opportunity to try something different that s how i ended up getting a refurbished iphone 13 here s what disappointed me first thing i bought it in pink but it actually looks more white than pink not a big deal but still i almost always keep my phone on silent since i spend most of my time in class or at work and i find the notification system absolutely terrible there s no small icon at the top of the screen and notifications barely show up on the lock screen so i have to manually check for them multiple times a day because of that i sometimes receive messages and completely forget to reply i don t understand why my home screen wallpaper is blurry i don t want it to be blurry and i don t know if there s a way to fix it in the settings either way i shouldn t have to dig through settings just to correct something like this when i turn off wi fi or bluetooth why does it only stay off until the next day before turning itself back on i get that maybe it s to prevent unnecessary data usage and sure maybe i could change this in the settings but i don t want to constantly mess around in the settings for basic things like this when i watch a youtube video in landscape mode while lying in bed the screen doesn t automatically rotate i have to exit fullscreen and reopen it for the orientation to be correct honestly i thought i d get used to it but i hate swiping to go back when i m watching slideshows on tiktok it s annoying to have to stretch my hand all the way to the edge of the screen just to go back it s just not practical in general there are so many restrictions on what i can do and i constantly feel like the phone is preventing me from using it how i want the mute switch on the left side i find it super impractical i have to fidget with it to know if my phone is on silent and sometimes there s a delay though i wonder if that s because my phone is refurbished and maybe the switch is faulty to adjust notification or alarm volume i have to go back to the home screen because if an app is open i can t adjust the system volume directly face id i don t know if mine is buggy but a friend who has always used iphones tried it and said it was normal so i guess that s just how it works but personally i find it super slow sometimes it doesn t work and when i m lying down it doesn t always recognize me i had to make a reddit post complaining about face id just for someone to tell me that when unlocking my phone i could tap face id to enter my passcode faster like it s written nowhere that i could do that how was i supposed to guess the photos honestly aren t that impressive i compared them to my 2018 galaxy s8 and while they re decent quality they re nothing incredible in fact i find them a bit dull there are no numbers displayed at the top of my keyboard when i log into something and receive an sms code i have to tap on it manually to autofill it whereas even my 2018 galaxy s8 did this automatically okay maybe i m nitpicking here but still to turn off my phone i have to press the power button and volume up at the same time the first time i had to ask a friend for help because i just couldn t figure it out i mean if there s a power button logically holding it should turn the phone off the default calculator app is garbage right i m a waitress and i use my phone s calculator to count my cash register at the end of the night who thought it was a good idea to remove the calculation history i don t get it they want the phone to be so sleek and minimalist that it actually becomes unusable i had to download a separate calculator app which is just ridiculous when someone calls me there s no direct decline button on the screen again not a big deal but i find it inconvenient the phone gets scratched super easily when i first got it i had to use it for two days without a case because mine hadn t arrived yet despite being careful the metal edges already got scratched and i have no idea how the snooze lasts 9 minutes writing and editing text on an iphone is unnecessarily complicated i can t close all my browser tabs at once i know that a lot of these issues can probably be fixed in the settings but 1 i shouldn t have to dig through settings for things that to me should be basic 2 a brand new iphone is ridiculously expensive i m so glad i didn t buy the latest model because for the price this phone should be reading my mind to give you an idea in the first month i was so disappointed compared to everything iphone fans had told me that i actually went to an apple store to check if my phone was even real i know i m complaining about a lot of little things and maybe i m just used to android which makes some things stand out more but considering the insane price of an iphone i feel like i have every right to nitpick anyway i think i ll sell my phone this summer i hate doing that i ve always used my phones until they were completely broken but i just can t see myself keeping it i ll get something else instead edit i also want to say that i don t like not being able to place my app icons on the home screen wherever i want i don t get it the phone costs an entire month s salary if i m paying that much and i want a page with a big empty space in the middle with no apps i should have the right to do that right i swear i constantly feel like there s someone stopping me from using my phone the way i want for no valid reason ","177":"which model has both 1 the longest battery

always got samsung phones i don t realy know why but happens i was always a bit bias towards them but this last years the underdogs start to catch up my only doubt is if the software is quick fluid and is it is stays that way or get slow easily btw one think that got me mad with my current phone is that sometimes during pokemon go appears a blue line on the bottom like notifying of something and disappears but the performance in game gets worse my only guess is that the phone is getting to much hot and the software cuts the performance to lower temperature but is realy annoying i preferred to

thinking about how similar ios and android are today but at the same time it s crazy that small details make all the difference my biggest pet peeve with ios is the lack of a back button i often look at people in public transport to see how they manage to go back with iphones no matter if they are young or old male or female the back gesture works 80 of the time for them it s just that they re used to it so if it fails they immediately do it again i don t think that s a nice user experience for such a common action if only it was as simple as doing the gesture no no sometimes the gesture doesnt work just because the developer of the app didn t implement it then you learn you can only tap the arrow button on the top left sometimes you realize you can only continue with the flow of the app eg tapping next sometimes you realize the gesture doesnt work because there s a done cancel text button at the top right corner now even if they fixed that mess and added a navigation bar like on android there are still pet peeves that would keep me from moving 1 you can t plug an iphone to a pc and expect to see files and folders you need to use itunes 2 you can t safely charge an iphone with a wireless charger that isn t an original apple one 40 as the phone can get crazy hot even without a case 3 the notifications are hard to dismiss you need to do a weird swipe down to expose that view and then a broad gesture to dismiss it towards the bottom 4 no double tap to turn off the screen and lock 5 face id forces you to pick up the phone so no unlocking when it s flat on a table unless you

iphone to get the android users into the apple ecosystem the issue at time was that since it was a parts binned phone it looked dated even though it had their fastest soc of that time in it it was a great budget offering by apple to be a gateway device into the apple ecosystem further they increased the price of the iphone se3 to 429 in 2022 no biggie with the launch of the iphone 16e the successor of the iphone se series apple lost the game big time first they killed both the iphone se series and the iphone 14 series and positioned price wise the iphone 16e at 599 which was the price of the iphone 14 a day before with the removal of the iphone se series the entry price to the apple ecosystem starts at 599 now starting at 599 isn t a bad thing at all the issue is that apple is giving it a bad value apple has positioned the iphone 16e as a price anchor just to make the value of the iphone 15 series and iphone 16 series that much more attractive apple wants us to compare it with the iphone se but it s true comparison should be with the iphone 14 which the iphone 16e is a price replacement of comparison with the iphone 14 no magsafe no ultrawide camera no macro

terms of price the iphone 15 at 699 which is 100 more than the iphone 16e looks really tempting while keeping in mind the it being a 18 month old phone comes with apple s a16 soc compared to iphone 16e s a18 soc and no apple intelligence features it further looks even more appealing when compared against the iphone 16 at 799 a 200 price jump you for sure are getting a lot for 200 more the iphone 16e is in no way a bad phone it s not a phone that no one should buy it s just a terrible value there have been a lot of corners cut to make it a distinct downgrade from the iphone 16 and the price hasn t come down accordingly this exact same phone at 499 would have been an excellent deal and apple would have had another mac mini m4 moment at 599 it just too expensive for the amount of features missing on a brighter note it might have the longest battery life amongst the iphone 16 series would i recommend the iphone 16e for most people no it s absolutely not worth it however i would recommend this iphone for the elders in your family the people who need longer battery life longer support life with software updates for those who have gotten used to ios and who use an iphone only for facetime or imessages and would find it hard to migrate to android to everyone else it s just not worth it if you re on a tight budget and absolutely need an iphone i would highly recommend that you check third party stores as they ll be clearing out their iphone 14 series stock and maybe you could get it at an even cheaper price for the rest of you who need an upgrade or a new iphone i can t believe apple s price anchor strategy is working here i suggest you save a little more and go for the iphone 16 it s a way better deal as compared to the iphone 16e finally i ll end with a prediction the next iphone in apple s e series presumably iphone 17e would come back to earth with it s pricing to 499 and apple is gonna use it a selling point apple s most affordable iphone now even cheaper or
